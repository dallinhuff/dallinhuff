# About Me

I'm a full-stack software engineer living in Utah.
I leverage cutting-edge technologies to build resilient, principled, and pragmatic solutions.

I'm currently a software integrations engineer at [Opiniion, Inc.](https://opiniion.com), where I'm building fault-tolerant, event-driven microservices for fetching & processing third-party data in real-time.

Previously, I interned as a SWE at [Fidelity Investments](https://www.fidelity.com/) on the cloud & platform team, where I built and deployed apps & services on Kubernetes for an internal feature request portal.

# I can help with

- Backend web development (Go, Scala, Rust, Node.js, Java)
- Frontend web development (Vue, React, Laminar)
- Relational databases (PostgreSQL, CockroachDB, etc.)
- NoSQL databases (MongoDB, DynamoDB, etc.)
- Containerization & deployment (Docker, Kubernetes, AWS)
- Async messaging (Apache Pulsar, RabbitMQ, SQS)
- and more...
